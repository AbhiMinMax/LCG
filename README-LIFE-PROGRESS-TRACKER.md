## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality

- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for quick load times and smooth interactions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Development Mode
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:5173
```

### Option 2: Production Build + HTTPS Tunnel
```bash
npm run build
cd dist && http-server -p 8080 --cors
ngrok http 8080
# Access via ngrok HTTPS URL for full PWA features
```

## 📖 How It Works

### The XP System
Every life situation you encounter can be handled in 4 ways:

| Choice | Description | XP Impact |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Poor response | -5 XP |
| 2 | Below average | -2 XP |
| 3 | Good response | +2 XP |
| 4 | Excellent response | +5 XP |

### Level Progression
- **XP Range**: 0-99 per level
- **Level Up**: When XP ≥ 100, level increases and XP resets
- **XP Protection**: XP cannot go below 0, levels cannot go below 1

### Sample Data Included
The app comes pre-loaded with:

**Situations:**
- Work Meeting Conflict
- Health Challenge  
- Relationship Communication
- Learning Opportunity
- Financial Decision

**Opportunities (Skills):**
- Leadership
- Communication
- Health & Wellness
- Continuous Learning
- Financial Intelligence
- Problem Solving

## 📱 App Screens

- Select situation from dropdown
- Describe what happened
- Choose your response (1-4)
- See real-time preview of XP impacts
- Submit to update all linked opportunities

### 2. 📊 Check Progress
Monitor your skill development:
- View all opportunities with current levels and XP

### 4. ⚙️ Customize
Manage your situations and opportunities:
- **Situations Tab**: Add/edit/delete life situations
- **Opportunities Tab**: Add/edit/delete skills to track
- **Link Management**: Connect situations to opportunities
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents deletion of items with history

## 💾 Data Storage

### Database Schema
The app uses Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper) with these tables:

**Situations Table**
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  created_at: Date,
  updated_at: Date
}
```

**Opportunities Table**  
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  current_xp: number (0-99),
  current_level: number (≥1),
  created_at: Date,
  updated_at: Date
}
```

**Events Table**
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  situation_id: number,
  event_description: string,
  choice_value: number (1-4),
  xp_change: number (-5|-2|2|5),
  timestamp: Date,
  affected_opportunities: Array<number>
}
```

**Situation_Opportunities Junction Table**
```javascript
{
  situation_id: number,
  opportunity_id: number
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, React Router DOM
- **Database**: Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper)
- **Bundler**: Vite 7
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
- **PWA**: Custom implementation with Web App Manifest

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Offline-First Design
- All functionality works without internet
- Local database handles all CRUD operations
- No server dependencies
- Data persists between sessions

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── Navigation.jsx          # Bottom navigation bar
├── screens/
│   ├── AddEvent.jsx           # Event logging screen
│   ├── CheckProgress.jsx      # Progress tracking screen

```

### Business Logic
